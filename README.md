#MATLAB

The following MATLAB code provides a framework for the analysis we conducted. This analysis shows the system wattage required to counteract the heat generated by a person's metabolism and the convection from a car moving at high speed through ambient air. We used this to get a framework for the estimated wattage the system will run at and a reasonable range of ambient air conditions that we could cool/heat in

#Python

The python code provided is made to run on the STM-32 adafruit feather board. Please reference the provided comments on setup specifics.
